            <p>
              If you want to send a spacecraft all the way to Mars, first you’ll
              need a fast rocket to escape the pull of Earth’s gravity. The
              heavier your spacecraft, the more powerful your rocket needs to be
              to lift off. Next, make sure you launch at the right time. Mars
              and Earth orbit the sun at different speeds and distances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earth to Mars transportation requirements are derived for a
              permanent Mars base of 20 people operating in the 2035 time frame.
              In order to satisfy these requirements, various transportation
              modes are developed assuming an existing space infrastructure
              including propellant tankers, crew and consumable transfer
              vehicles, orbital facilities and extraterrestrial propellant
              factories. These transportation modes are compared with respect to
              total propellant requirements, number of vehicles required, flight
              times, frequency of opportunity and several other characteristics.
              Directions for further studies and analysis are indicated

            <p>
              The Mars Transit Vehicle is a compact space station that will
              carry the astronauts from Earth orbit to Mars. It is comprised of
              four parts which are docked in Earth orbit: two propellant stages,
              a Transit Habitat and a Lander. The propellant stages are used to
              propel the Transit Vehicle from Earth orbit to Mars.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a start, the sheer distance. Astronauts bound for Mars will
              have to travel about 140 million miles (225 million kilometers),
              depending on where the two planets are relative to each other.
              That means a trip that’s many months long, where astronauts will
              face two major health risks: radiation and microgravity.

              spacecraft, and to glide to a runway landing on its return to
              Earth’s surface that was developed by the U.S. National
              Aeronautics.

              and, most importantly, the astronaut spacesuits – known as
              “extravehicular mobility units.” Each spacesuit weighs over 200
              pounds and is received in four pieces.

            <h4>6 Technologies NASA is Advancing to Send Humans to Mars</h4>
            <h5>
              1.Powerful propulsion systems to get us there (and home!) quicker.
            </h5>
            <p>
              Astronauts bound for Mars will travel about 140 million miles into
              deep space. Advancements in propulsion capabilities are the key to
              reaching our destination as quickly and safely as possible. <br />
              <br />
              It is too soon to say which propulsion system will take astronauts
              to Mars, but we know it needs to be nuclear-enabled to reduce
              travel time. NASA is advancing multiple options, including nuclear
              electric and nuclear thermal propulsion. Both use nuclear fission
              but are very different from each other. A nuclear electric rocket
              is more efficient, but it doesn’t generate a lot of thrust.
              Nuclear thermal propulsion, on the other hand, provides much more
              “oomph.” <br />
              <br />
              Whichever system is selected, the fundamentals of nuclear
              propulsion will reduce the crew’s time away from Earth. The agency
              and its partners are developing, testing, and maturing critical
              components of various propulsion technologies to reduce the risk
              of the first human mission to Mars.

            <h5>
              2.Inflatable heat shield to land astronauts on other planets
            </h5>
            <p>
              The largest rover we’ve landed on Mars is about the size of a car,
              and sending humans to Mars will require a much bigger spacecraft.
              New technologies will allow heavier spacecraft to enter the
              Martian atmosphere, approach the surface, and land close to where
              astronauts want to explore. <br />
              <br />
              NASA is working on an inflatable heat shield that allows the large
              surface area to take up less space in a rocket than a rigid one.
              The technology could land spacecraft on any planet with an
              atmosphere. It would expand and inflate before it enters the
              Martian atmosphere to land cargo and astronauts safely. <br />
              <br />
              The technology isn’t ready for the Red Planet just yet. An
              upcoming flight test of a 6-meter diameter (about 20-feet)
              prototype will demonstrate how the aeroshell performs as it enters
              Earth’s atmosphere. The test will prove it can survive the intense
              heat during entry at Mars.
            </p>
            <h5>3. High-tech Martian spacesuits</h5>
            <p>
              Spacesuits are essentially custom spacecraft for astronauts.
              NASA’s latest spacesuit is so high-tech, its modular design is
              engineered to be evolved for use anywhere in space. <br />
              <br />
              The first woman and the next man on the Moon will wear NASA’s
              next-generation spacesuits called the exploration extravehicular
              mobility unit or xEMU. The spacesuits prioritize crew safety while
              also allowing Artemis Generation moonwalkers to make more natural,
              Earth-like movements and accomplish tasks that weren’t possible
              during the Apollo missions. <br />
              <br />
              Future upgrades to address the differences on Mars may include
              technology for life support functionality in the carbon
              dioxide-rich atmosphere and modified outer garments to keep
              astronauts warm during the Martian winter and prevent overheating
              in the summer season.
            </p>

            <h5>4. Martian home and lab on wheels</h5>
            <p>
              To reduce the number of items needed to land on the surface, NASA
              will combine the first Martian home and vehicle into a single
              rover complete with breathable air. <br />
              <br />
              NASA has conducted extensive rover testing on Earth to inform
              development of a pressurized mobile home on the Moon. Artemis
              astronauts who live and work in the future pressurized Moon rover
              will be able to offer feedback to help refine the rover
              capabilities for astronauts on Mars. NASA’s robotic rovers will
              help with the Martian design, too – everything from the best
              wheels for Mars to how a larger vehicle will navigate the tough
              terrain. <br />
              <br />
              Much like an RV, the pressurized rover will have everything inside
              that astronauts need to live and work for weeks. They can drive in
              comfortable clothing, tens of miles from the spacecraft that will
              launch them back to space for the return trip to Earth. When they
              encounter interesting locations, astronauts can put on their
              high-tech spacesuits to exit the rover and collect samples and
              conduct science experiments.
            </p>

            <h5>5. Uninterrupted power</h5>
            <p>
              Like we use electricity to charge our devices on Earth, astronauts
              will need a reliable power supply to explore Mars. The system will
              need to be lightweight and capable of running regardless of its
              location or the weather on the Red Planet. <br />
              <br />
              Mars has a day and night cycle like Earth and periodic dust storms
              that can last for months, making nuclear fission power a more
              reliable option than solar power. NASA already tested the
              technology on Earth and demonstrated it is safe, efficient, and
              plentiful enough to enable long-duration surface missions. NASA
              plans to demonstrate and use the fission power system on the Moon
              first, then Mars.
              <br />
            </p>

            <h5>6. Laser communications to send more information home</h5>
            <p>
              Human missions to Mars may use lasers to stay in touch with Earth.
              A laser communications system at Mars could send large amounts of
              real-time information and data, including high-definition images
              and video feeds. <br /><br />
              Sending a map of Mars to Earth might take nine years with current
              radio systems, but as little as nine weeks with laser
              communications. The technology would also allow us to communicate
              with astronauts, to see and hear more of their adventures on the
              Red Planet. <br />
              <br />
              NASA proved laser communications is possible with a demonstration
              from the Moon in 2013. The agency’s next demo will work through
              different operational scenarios, perfect the pointing system, and
              address technology challenges from low-Earth orbit – things like
              clouds and other communications disruptions. NASA is building
              small systems to test for human spaceflight, including on the
              International Space Station and the first crewed Artemis mission.
              Another laser communications payload will venture to deep space to
              help inform what it takes to use the same technology millions and
              millions of miles away from Earth.
