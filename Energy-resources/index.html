                    <p class="blog-post-meta">by Dixita Pagar</p>

                    <p>Hey, stop! We have to think, how will we operate our space station on the surface of mars?
                        What energy resource we will use? What will provide our rovers and machinery power? Let us
                        see one by one.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>To the date two energy resources utilized for mars mission have been sunlight and radioactive
                        decay. A manned mission or permananat settlement would likely also have to choose between these
                        two.</p>

                    <h4>Useful resources on Mars</h4>
                    <p>Spacecraft exploration of Mars has shown that the essential resources necessary for life support
                        are present on the martian surface. The key life-support compounds O2, N2, and H2O are available
                        on Mars. The soil could be used as radiation shielding and could provide many useful industrial
                        and construction materials. Compounds with high chemical energy, such as rocket fuels, can be
                        manufactured in-situ on Mars. Solar power, and possibly wind power, are available and practical
                        on Mars. Preliminary engineering studies indicate that fairly autonomous processes can be
                        designed to extract and stockpile Martian consumables. The ability to utilize these materials in
                        support of a human exploration effort allows missions that are more robust and economical than
                        would otherwise be possible.</p>
                    <p>Magnesium, Aluminium, Titanium, Iron, and Chromium are relatively common in them. In addition,
                        lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, niobium, molybdenum, lanthanum, europium, tungsten, and
                        gold have been found in trace amounts.</p>

                    <h4>Generate electricity on Mars</h4>
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522735395567-43c00b2897a7?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=889&q=80" alt="windmill" class="img-fluid py-3">
                    <p>Wind turbines designed to make electricity at the South Pole and in remote regions of Alaska may
                        someday lead to similar wind machines for Mars bases, according to NASA scientists.</p>
                    <p>During missions to Antarctica, where there are about six months of darkness each year, NASA
                        scientists first seriously considered modifying cold-weather wind machines so they could make
                        vital electric power for bases on Mars. One reason scientists proposed use of wind power on Mars
                        is that wind turbines still could generate electricity during month-long martian global dust
                        storms that can make days on the red planet as dark as night.</p>
                    <p>"Wind power and solar power may complement each other on Mars. When you have a large dust storm
                        blocking the sunlight on Mars, a wind turbine can still generate electricity," said scientist
                        David Bubenheim of NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley.</p>
                    <p>"Only during dust storms on Mars is there enough wind energy to operate a wind turbine," said
                        Michael Flynn, another NASA Ames scientist. On Earth about 10 meters (33 feet) per second wind
                        speed is needed to make electricity with wind turbines; on Mars about 30 meters (98 feet) is
                        needed because of the extremely thin air, according to Bubenheim.</p>

                    <h4>Does Mars have oxygen?</h4>
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620418583334-4edb19ffc86e?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=889&q=80" alt="o2" class="img-fluid py-3">
                    <p>Atmospheric gases on Mars sure provide us with plenty of mystery. First, there was that business
                        with the disappearing, reappearing methane. Now, oxygen levels have been observed rising and
                        falling over the Gale Crater, by amounts that just don't fit any known chemical processes.</p>
                    <p>The data comes from Curiosity, the Mars rover that's been making its slow and methodical trek
                        across the crater floor and up the foot of Mount Sharp in the centre of it.</p>
                    <p>Mars' atmosphere is dominated by carbon dioxide (CO₂) at a concentration of 96%. Oxygen is only
                        0.13%, compared with 21% in Earth's atmosphere. Moxie can strip oxygen atoms from CO₂ molecules,
                        which are made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.</p>

                    <p>The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment is a technology demonstration on the NASA
                        Mars 2020 rover Perseverance investigating the production of oxygen on Mars. On April 20, 2021,
                        MOXIE produced oxygen from carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere by using solid oxide
                        electrolysis.</p>

                    <h4>Martian Rock and Soil</h4>
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1585494870110-1ee96894284a?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=752&q=80" alt="rock and soil" class="img-fluid py-3">
                    <p>The surface of the planet Mars exhibits a world of reddish rock, soil, and dust as
                        revealed by Mars landers. Such an environment is quite distinct from
                        the earth except for the desert areas and the big question is whether we can
                        find or produce soils suitable for agriculture on Mars. If we send astronauts to
                        Mars, they will have to stay for 18-24 months. </p>
                    <p>Therefore, considering agriculture is important to living off the land, recycle
                        air, water, provide food etc as reviewed by Ming and Henninger (1989). In this
                        chapter we review the information about the chemistry and mineralogy of the
                        rocks and soils present on the surface of Mars and then discuss available resources
                        and energy sources that can be utilized to perform Martian agriculture. There is
                        also discussion of using released methane.</p>
                    <p>There are mainly two available sources to obtain information about rocks and soils
                        on Mars. One is from direct analyses of meteorites originating from Mars that were ejected by
                        heavy impacts that eventually reached the earth. The other is from
                        data collected by spacecraft exploration of Mars. Both sources have provided
                        valuable insight into the geochemistry and mineralogy of Mars surface materials. </p>

                    <h4>Nuclear energy</h4>
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556834234-f876cf788b3c?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=889&q=80" alt="nuclear" class="img-fluid py-3">
                    <p>Nuclear power is an attractive alternative to solar for several reasons. Its power output is
                        constant in time, meaning less risk of prolonged power shortages that could prove hazardous to a
                        human crew. It also weighs less per nameplate capacity than does solar when considering a Mars
                        operating environment - a 2016 NASA study found that about 18,000 kg of solar power generation
                        equipment would be needed to match the output of a 9000 kg fission system. This was considering
                        a relatively small system meant to provide 21 kW peak electric power for a handful of
                        astronauts, which translates to roughly 1.2 watts per kilogram for the solar power system and
                        2.3 watts per kilogram for the nuclear system.</p>
                    <p>The nighttime temperature on Mars as measured by the Opportunity rover reach as low as -98°C with
                        diurnal temperature variations of up to 100°C, so even a temporary power loss in such an
                        environment could quickly become life-threatening as the heating systems fail. This presents
                        another advantage of nuclear power: even in the event of an electrical fault, the passive heat
                        from the reactor or radioisotopes could be used to warm the habitat.</p>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>Though solar is increasingly popular on Earth, its intermittency, especially in the face of
                        extreme weather events like long-lasting dust storms, makes it is less attractive on Mars.
                        Considerable storage would be necessary to provide adequate backup power, which would result in
                        a very heavy system. In contrast, nuclear power could provide both steady electricity and a
                        constant source of direct heat. Thus, from a reliability perspective, nuclear power appears
                        better suited to powering a small Mars colony. However, this is not to say that nuclear power is
                        necessarily the best technology for extraterrestrial planetary outposts - it does introduce a
                        set of safety and environmental concerns that may necessitate further testing and research to
                        address.</p>
