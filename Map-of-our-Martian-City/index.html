              <p>
                The Mars Treaty was finally signed at the United Nations in
                Geneva on December 1st, 2024, two months after the launch of the
                Starship Heart of Gold, on the first-ever journey to Mars by a
                private company. The Treaty, signed by member states from every
                continent, enabled 74 private companies and large and small
                states to join forces and fund the Mars Consortium, which went
                on to establish Star City on Mars
              </p>

              <h4>The Star City Concept</h4>
              <p>
                <b
                  >“If we want to put humans on Mars, we’ll need humans on
                  Mars.”
                </b>
                Star City exports Hope, Promise and Know-How. The Star City
                Guild builds new cities on Mars, inspires millions of young
                people who watch Star City’s blinking lasers from their backyard
                telescopes and trains leaders who return to Earth to rebuild
                devastated communities. If humans from all around the world can
                work together to build cities on Mars, where even the air we
                breathe must be made in a machine, they can inspire the rest of
                us to work together to make our Planet Earth a better place for
                all. The New Space companies are in the transportation business,
                moving people and equipment between Earth and Mars. The Star
                City Development Guild (“the Guild”) are the experts who can
                build anything on Mars, from a small dome to a complete town for
                thousands of people. With their fleet of mobile nuclear reactors
                and heavy roadheaders, their extensive industrial base, and
                above all their know- how and expertise, the Guild earns enough
                from the Mars construction and outfitting business to pay for
                the necessary imports of advanced high-tech parts and spares.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Star City University manages exploration and scientific
                research on Mars, on behalf of sponsors from Earth. It also
                offers the ultimate leadership training programs, pairs
                researchers and visitors from Earth on expeditions, and produces
                art, poetry and Martian musical instruments sold to Earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Star City Spaceport is investing in an ever-growing network
                of refueling nodes at the Sun- Mars Lagrange points, on Phobos
                and in the asteroid belt. Their strategy is to become the go-to
                supplier for propellant beyond Earth orbit, opening up deep
                space to their customers.
              </p>

              <h4>Building Star City</h4>
              <p>
                <b>Site Selection </b> : We have reviewed the USGS maps of Mars
                NASA’s Human Landing Sites workshops and also its ongoing
                project for Subsurface Water Ice Mapping (SWIM). In producing a
                shortlist of regions suitable for Star City, the criteria were:
                in Northern Hemisphere; low altitude for safer landings;
                abundance of shallow subsurface water ice deposits; rock quality
                suitable for tunneling and supporting tunnels; suitable
                landforms for tunneling inside mesas or crater walls;
                availability of other critical resources such as metals,
                silicates, sulfates etc. and proximity to areas of scientific
                interest and natural beauty. Tunneling in competent rock
                formations is used for the construction of the majority of the
                habitable volume. Accordingly, the first landings in the 2024 -
                2026 timeframe investigate one or more of the candidate sites to
                validate the geomorphological assumptions and provide data to
                refine the tunneling concept of operations for the Star City
                campaign which follows from 2028 - 2042.
              </p>

              <h4>Subtractive Construction</h4>
              <p>
                Habitable volume at Star City is created primarily by
                subtractive construction. Each of the five founding villages
                around the crater uses crawler-mounted roadheaders, two 130-ton
                Sandvik MT720 and two 60-ton MT361’s. These can be operated
                economically in rock formations with uniaxial compressive
                strength up to 140 MPa. Each roadheader is all-electric and can
                be remote-controlled via PLC to create up to 480 m3 of new
                habitable volume per day. The Guild uses these to construct
                secure, long-lived tunnels for transportation, storage,
                residences, aquaponics, industry, services, and pumped hydro
                storage.
              </p>
              <h4>Colony Urban Concept</h4>
              <p>
                Star City can be constructed in craters of diameter from 2km -
                10km. The scheme presented in Fig. 3 below has been fitted to a
                10km crater located in Utopia Planitia at 40.8N, 99.5E, altitude
                -4,000 meters [04], but can be adapted for other craters. The
                site first receives power, ISRU and heavy equipment in the 2029
                window. In November 2031, two Starships by SpaceX with 30
                passengers each land near the site. Each of the two Starships
                carries five teams of six persons, one from each of the five
                continental groupings. Thus, there are 12 founders of the “red”
                sector 1 village in Figure 3 below, 12 founders of the “blue”
                sector 2 village, and so on. In all, the first 60 persons on
                Mars start five villages simultaneously. Between 2031 and 2042,
                more people and equipment arrive and the villages continue to
                expand their habitable volume perimetrically along the crater
                wall, until they merge to form Star City. All tunnel tailings
                are mined for water ice and useful resources such as metals and
                silicates, while the north-facing inside wall of the crater is
                reserved for supplemental water ice mining.
              </p>
              <p>
                Urban plan of Star City. Each of the five founding villages
                grows perimetrically along the crater wall. The villages are
                connected by transportation and services tunnels so they can
                share people and resources and come to each other’s aid. As Star
                City grows, the five villages merge into a city with five
                culturally distinct neighborhoods. At some point, once they can
                afford it, they pool their resources to build facilities for
                arts, culture, school, a university and a hospital at the center
                of the crater.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cross sectional view b-b. The five villages have panoramic views
                of each other across the crater, and of the Martian horizon.
                Each village is self-sufficient, with its own power generation
                and backup power system, and its own aquaponics and industrial
                zones. Each of the five villages is tackling the same survival
                challenges in their own way, and in a contingency or emergency,
                each can rely on help from the other four.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cross sectional view a-a. The residential tunnels and domes are
                located along the top of the crater wall, with panoramic views
                from the domes to the other four villages or to the distant
                horizon. Rover access is at ground level of the surrounding
                plains, with unpressurized rover garages situated directly below
                the agro-industrial tunnels.
              </p>
              <h4>Energy-rich colony</h4>
              <p>
                An integrated power grid stepped down to 1000V, 240V and 110V AC
                is supplied by the three 95MWe IMSR load-following nuclear
                reactors by Terrestrial Energy, which operate at a useful 700C
                providing high quality process heat for industry, and are
                walk-away safe in the event of an accident. All cooling takes
                place in the molten salt loop, with a secondary salt circuit
                transferring heat to the water loop and driving the steam
                turbine. The lifetime is 7 years, after which the core must be
                replaced. Each of the three IMSR reactors can carry the entire
                load if required. Exploiting the height differences, five pumped
                hydro systems holding ~22,000 tons of water each are installed
                in the mid 2030’s, providing up to 30 minutes of backup @ 20MWe.
                Five additional MegaPower 2MWe reactors [07] serve for ISRU
                propellant and also as redundant emergency backup for the five
                villages.
              </p>
              <h4>The Economy of Star City</h4>
              <p>
                Overview of Economic Concept The central economic motivation for
                the consortium of investors is to establish Star City
                Development Guild as the lowest cost provider for construction
                of habitable outposts on Mars and to thereby reap an economic
                benefit by selling the establishment of other outposts to
                second-movers. This space is already being actively monitored,
                as evidenced by the space interests of decidedly non-space
                companies like Caterpillar, Obayashi and Kajima and of
                professional firms like Foster + Partners and SOM. This would
                not normally be a viable business model, except that a new space
                race is under way. Major powers and/or well-funded private
                corporations have clearly and repeatedly declared their intent
                to return humans to other worlds and to create permanent
                settlements there.
