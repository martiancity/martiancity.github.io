              <h4>The Martian City Concept</h4>
              <p>
                <b
                  >“If we want to put humans on Mars, we’ll need humans on
                  Mars.”
                </b>
                Star City exports Hope, Promise and Know-How. The Star City
                Guild builds new cities on Mars, inspires millions of young
                people who watch Star City’s blinking lasers from their backyard
                telescopes and trains leaders who return to Earth to rebuild
                devastated communities. If humans from all around the world can
                work together to build cities on Mars, where even the air we
                breathe must be made in a machine, they can inspire the rest of
                us to work together to make our Planet Earth a better place for
                all. The New Space companies are in the transportation business,
                moving people and equipment between Earth and Mars. The Star
                City Development Guild (“the Guild”) are the experts who can
                build anything on Mars, from a small dome to a complete town for
                thousands of people. With their fleet of mobile nuclear reactors
                and heavy roadheaders, their extensive industrial base, and
                above all their know- how and expertise, the Guild earns enough
                from the Mars construction and outfitting business to pay for
                the necessary imports of advanced high-tech parts and spares.

              <p>
                We have reviewed the USGS maps of Mars NASA’s Human Landing
                Sites workshops and also its ongoing project for Subsurface
                Water Ice Mapping (SWIM). In producing a shortlist of regions
                suitable for Star City, the criteria were: in Northern
                Hemisphere; low altitude for safer landings; abundance of
                shallow subsurface water ice deposits; rock quality suitable for
                tunneling and supporting tunnels; suitable landforms for
                tunneling inside mesas or crater walls; availability of other
                critical resources such as metals, silicates, sulfates etc. and
                proximity to areas of scientific interest and natural beauty.
                Tunneling in competent rock formations is used for the
                construction of the majority of the habitable volume

              <h4>Colony Urban Concept</h4>
              <p>
                Star City can be constructed in craters of diameter from 2km -
                10km. The scheme presented in Fig. 3 below has been fitted to a
                10km crater located in Utopia Planitia at 40.8N, 99.5E, altitude
                -4,000 meters, but can be adapted for other craters. The site
                first receives power, ISRU and heavy equipment in the 2029
                window. Two Starships by SpaceX with 30 passengers each land
                near the site. Each of the two Starships carries five teams of
                six persons, one from each of the five continental groupings.
                Thus, there are 12 founders of the “red” sector 1 village in
                Figure 3 below, 12 founders of the “blue” sector 2 village, and
                so on. In all, the first 60 persons on Mars start five villages
                simultaneously. By the time more people and equipment arrive and
                the villages continue to expand their habitable volume
                perimetrically along the crater wall, until they merge to form
                Star City. All tunnel tailings are mined for water ice and
                useful resources such as metals and silicates, while the
                north-facing inside wall of the crater is reserved for
                supplemental water ice mining.
              </p>

                Urban plan of Star City. Each of the five founding villages
                grows perimetrically along the crater wall. The villages are
                connected by transportation and services tunnels so they can
                share people and resources and come to each other’s aid. As Star
                City grows, the five villages merge into a city with five
                culturally distinct neighborhoods. At some point, once they can
                afford it, they pool their resources to build facilities for
                arts, culture, school, a university and a hospital at the center
                of the crater.

                Cross sectional view b-b. The five villages have panoramic views
                of each other across the crater, and of the Martian horizon.
                Each village is self-sufficient, with its own power generation
                and backup power system, and its own aquaponics and industrial
                zones. Each of the five villages is tackling the same survival
                challenges in their own way, and in a contingency or emergency,
                each can rely on help from the other four.

                Cross sectional view a-a. The residential tunnels and domes are
                located along the top of the crater wall, with panoramic views
                from the domes to the other four villages or to the distant
                horizon. Rover access is at ground level of the surrounding
                plains, with unpressurized rover garages situated directly below
                the agro-industrial tunnels.

              <p>
                Overview of Economic Concept The central economic motivation for
                the consortium of investors is to establish Star City
                Development Guild as the lowest cost provider for construction
                of habitable outposts on Mars and to thereby reap an economic
                benefit by selling the establishment of other outposts to
                second-movers. This space is already being actively monitored,
                as evidenced by the space interests of decidedly non-space
                companies like Caterpillar, Obayashi and Kajima and of
                professional firms like Foster + Partners and SOM. This would
                not normally be a viable business model, except that a new space
                race is under way. Major powers and/or well-funded private
                corporations have clearly and repeatedly declared their intent
                to return humans to other worlds and to create permanent
                settlements there.

              <h4>Question & Answers</h4>

              <b>1. What are some challenges to colonizing Mars?</b>
              <p>
                Difficulties and hazards include radiation exposure during a
                trip to Mars and on its surface, toxic soil, low gravity, the
                isolation that accompanies Mars' distance from Earth, a lack of
                water, and cold temperatures.
              </p>

              <b>2. Why we choices mars for colonization ?</b>
              <p>
                After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar
                system due to several reasons: <br />
                Its soil contains water to extract <br />
                It isn’t too cold or too hot <br />
                There is enough sunlight to use solar panels <br />
                Gravity on Mars is 38% that of our Earth's, which is believed by
                many to be sufficient for the human body to adapt to <br />
                It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that offers protection
                from cosmic and the Sun's radiation <br />
                The day/night rhythm is very similar to ours here on Earth: a
                Mars day is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds

              <b>3. What life on Earth could survive on Mars?</b>
              <p>
                Scientists have found that some Earth microbes could survive on
                Mars temporarily after testing several types of bacteria and
                fungi for their survival skills by launching them into Earth’s
                stratosphere on the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for
                Radiation, and Biological Outcomes experiment) space balloon,
                since the conditions up there are the closest our planet has to
                Martian atmospheric conditions. There is even one that could
                laugh in the face of space radiation.
