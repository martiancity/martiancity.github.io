                    <p class="blog-post-meta">by Sujata Khatale</p>
                    <p>We are planning to migrate to a different planet, but we don't know how the Planet is different from ours. Let us find out the differences between our lovely planet earth and our next home Mars.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Earth vs Mars</h4>
                    <p>Difference between Earth and Mars is a very hot topic as currently humans are exploring Mars to see whether it can support life. Earth and Mars are terrestrial planets that form part of our solar system. They are two different planets that show differences between them in terms of their characteristics and properties. The Earth is a planet that supports life better than Mars. This is due to the favorable living conditions it offers to the living beings by virtue of its acceptable distance from the sun. From among the planets in our solar system, Mars is the planet that resembles Earth the most though there are differences. That is why scientists are experimenting in creating colonies in Mars for humans to live. Mars is considered to be the Earthâ€™s closest neighbor planet in the space.</p>
                    <h4>More about Earth</h4>
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.differencebetween.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Difference-Between-Earth-and-Mars_Earth-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1" alt="earth" class="img-fluid rounded">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun. Earth is situated at a distance of 149, 597, 891 kilometers (92, 955, 820 miles) from the Sun. The Earth spins or rotates on its axis from west to east. This rotation causes day and night. The Earth completes one rotation every 24 hours. As the earth rotates on its axis, it also revolves or moves around the Sun. The earth completes one revolution around the sun in about 365 days. This period of time is called as a year. The axis of Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees. The Earth experiences different seasons because the axis of the earth is tilted 23.5 degrees. As a result, when it goes around the Sun, the seasons change.The Earth has the moon as its natural satellite.</p>

                    <h4>More about Mars</h4>
                    <br><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.differencebetween.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Difference-Between-Earth-and-Mars_Mars-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1" alt="mars" class="img-fluid rounded"><br><br>
                    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is also known as the red planet because of its colour, which is due to the rusty dust. With regard to the distance, the planet of Mars is situated at a distance of 227, 936, 637 kilometers (142, 633, 260 miles) from the Sun. The factor of light is also not conducive to life in the planet of Mars. The length of a day on Mars is 24 hours and 37 minutes. It takes 687 earth days for the planet of Mars to orbit the Sun. The axis of Mars is also slightly titled. It is tilted 25 degrees. Mars has two natural satellites or moons. They are Phobos and Deimos. The atmosphere of Mars contains Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen, Argon, Oxygen, Water Vapor, and Nitric Oxide. About 95% is Carbon Dioxide. Oxygen is only about 0.13%, which is very low.</p>

                    <h4> What is the difference between Earth and Mars?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun whereas Mars is the fourth planet from the sun.</li><br>
                        <li> Earth is situated 149, 597, 891 kilometers (92, 955, 820 miles) from theSun. Mars is situated at a distance of 227, 936, 637 kilometers (142, 633, 260 miles) from the Sun.</li><br>
                        <li> However, when it comes to size, Earth is almost twice the diameter of Mars. In other words, Earth is bigger than Mars. The diameter of the earth is 12, 742 km while that of mars is 6, 779 km.</li><br>
                        <li>Earth takes 365 days to go around the Sun. Mars takes 687 earth days to go around the Sun. In other words, the period Mars takes to go round the Sun is greater than the period Earth takes to go round the Sun.</li><br>
                        <li>As a result of Mars being situated further away from the Sun than the Earth, Mars is considered to be cooler than the Earth.</li><br>
                        <li>The time a planet takes to make a full rotation on its axis is known as the length of day of a planet. A day on Earth is 24 hours. A day on Mars is 24 hours and 37 minutes.</li><br>
                        <li>The axis of Earth is titled 23.5 degrees while the axis of Mars is titled 25 degrees.</li><br>
                        <li>Earth has water on its surface. Mars, however, does not have liquid water.</li><br>
                        <li>Both planets have moons or natural satellites. However, Earth has only one when Mars has two. The names of Martian moons are Phobos and Deimos.</li><br>
                        <li>The atmosphere of Earth contains Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. Nitrogen is in the highest amount and then oxygen. The atmosphere of Mars contains Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen, Argon, Oxygen, Water Vapor and Nitric Oxide. About 95% is Carbon Dioxide. Oxygen is only about 0.13% which is very low.</li><br>
                        <li> The gravity on Mars is about one third of the gravity on Earth.</li><br>
